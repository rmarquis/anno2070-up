41008003=The Tsunami is a devastating wave that not only destroys Ships in its path, but also floods entire sections of Islands, making those areas temporarily unsuitable for construction.
41008004=High mountains can hold back a Tsunami. So build in the lee of mountain ranges if you expect frequent floods.
41008006=As soon as one party in the sector unlocks access to the Financial market, Island Shares can then be purchased at the Warehouse.
41008007=If you have a majority of Shares in an enemy Island, you can take it over without Military conflict. But beware: Some parties react very badly to that.
41008008=For each Island Share purchased, a Dividend based on the current Share price will be paid to your Balance.
41008010=As the price of an Island Share increases as the Settlement develops, buying Shares early on is a good investment.
41008011=Some wealthy opponents will try to take over your Island by buying Ahares in it. To prevent that kind of hostile takeover, you should purchase as many Shares in your own Island as possible.
41008012=An Energy transmitter can transfer excess Energy from one Island to another.
41008014=If an Island is being supplied by an Energy transmitter it does not need its own Power plants, allowing it to avoid the negative consequences associated with Energy production.
41008015=The new and improved S.A.A.T Metal converter no longer has to wait until a Black Smoker goes extinct, but it does require a corresponding Deposit nearby.
41008016=The new [GUIDNAME 40000109] class Trade submarine can service Underwater Trading routes, thus avoiding enemy surface Units.
41008017=With the advent of Geniuses in our midst, the Academy can now research singularly high-yield methods of maximizing an Islands resources.
41008018=S.A.A.T. Geniuses have found a way of replicating Sokow Transnationals Oil-drilling technology. The appropriate Blueprints can be drawn up in an Academy .

41008020=Th?"[GUIDNAME 40000158]" Item can be used to hide Underwater units from enemy Units on the surface.
41008021=Cloaked Underwater units can be detected using the "[GUIDNAME 40000121]" Item.
41008022=Port facilities can be protected effectively by placing a [GUIDNAME 40000120] in front of your Warehouse. Where your Ships can pass safely, any enemy Ships will trigger a devastating explosion.

41604054=With your support I was able to locate the malfunction in the Geothermal power plant. It would take too long to explain the exact reason. Let us therefore simply say that an extremely strong pulse was unintentionally emitted while concentrating the Energy. We cannot disable the Power plant without causing more of these uncontrollable pulses.
41604055=But be warned, as repairing the system is dangerous, too. Since we cannot turn the Power plant off, the work must be carried out directly on the core itself. Construction of a Control center has therefore begun on a neighboring Island, which will then coordinate these complex interventions.
41604056=We dare not delay the repairs! The construction of this Control center is the key to preventing further tidal waves. You have to protect the works from all threats, while at the same time helping us repair the Geothermal power plant!
41604057=Oh no! A tidal wave!
41604058=What terrible destruction! What can we do?
41604059=Great! The Control center is ready to go! The repair work can now be continued in safety.
41604060=Very good! That devastating pulse will never happen again! I owe you and all those involved my most sincere thanks.
41604061=Thanks to you, we can continue to hope to one day enable the peaceful and safe use of Geothermal energy. Humanity will never forget you.
